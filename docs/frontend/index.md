## How does the Internet work?

[参考回答:](https://cs.fyi/guide/how-does-internet-work)
+ The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that uses a standard set of communication protocols to exchange data.
+ The internet works by connecting devices and computer systems together using standardized protocols, such as IP and TCP.
+ The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected routers that direct traffic between different devices and systems.
+ Basic concepts and terminology that you need to familiarize yourself with include packets, routers, IP addresses, domain names, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, and SSL/TLS.
+ Protocols play a critical role in enabling communication and data exchange over the internet, allowing devices and systems from different manufacturers and vendors to communicate seamlessly.




## What is HTTP 

> HTTP is the TCP/IP based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other. HTTP follows a classical “Client-Server model” with a client opening a connection request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, that means that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.

HTTP是基于TCP/IP的应用层通信协议，它规范了客户端和服务器之间的通信方式。HTTP遵循经典的`“客户机-服务器模型”`，客户机打开连接请求，然后等待，直到收到响应。HTTP是一种无状态协议，这意味着服务器在两个请求之间不保留任何数据(状态)。



## What is a Domain Name?

> A domain name is a unique, easy-to-remember address used to access websites, such as ‘google.com’, and ‘facebook.com’. Users can connect to websites using domain names thanks to the Domain Name System (DNS).

域名是一个独特的，易于记忆的地址，用于访问网站，如“google.com”和“facebook.com”。通过域名系统`DNS (domain Name System)`，用户可以通过域名连接到网站。
